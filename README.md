# Taskmint Task Manager

## Project Overview
Taskmint is a basic task manager/tracker. 

I began building Taskmint as part of teaching myself PHP and MySQL. It is still a work in progress. 

## Project Description
Currently, it's primary functionality is to add, view, edit, delete and search tasks. 
It is also possible to add 'comments' to each task. 

## Database details
It uses PDO to access the MySQL database.

## How to setup
Taskmint can be run using XAMPP. To do this, set the project files in XAMPP's htdocs folder. 
You will also need to download the database tables, which you can then import to phpMyadmin.

## How to use 
After installing, you will need to first create a user account. 
To do this, go to the Join tab, and create an account, filling out all fields. 
Then, you will be able to login and access the task manager dashboard.

### Adding a task
To add a task, use the form in the top left corner of the dashboard, labeled "Add Task".

### Editing a task
You can edit a task by navigating to the task you want to edit on the dashboard, and clicking the edit button.
This will take you to a new webpage where you can edit the task. 

### Adding a comment to a task
To add a comment to a task, you need to click on the relevant task's name on the dashboard.
This will take you to a new webpage, where you will be able to see a form that says add comment. 
To add a comment, fill out the form with your comment and it will display to the right hand side. 

### Deleting a task
To delete a task, you just need to click the delete button on the relevant task on the dashboard page. 

### Searching a task
To search a task, you just need to use the search form below the add task form.
This will then take you to a new page displaying your search results. 

### Editing user details
If you want to edit your user details, you just need to click the edit user button on the dashboard screen in the top left corner. 
This will take you to a new page, which provides you with a form to update your username and user email.

### Editing user password
If you forget your password or otherwise feel like changing it, just click the edit password button on the edit user page. 
This will then take you to a page where you can edit your password.
